# LearningUnreal5
 A repo containing projects I made while working through a Udemy course to learn Unreal Engine 5. (v5.3.2)
 
## Projects
1. IntroProject - The third person template with added blocks for platforming. This was to introduce basic Unreal tools.
2. WarehouseWreckage - A simple project where the player shoots physics-enabled spheres at a set of warehouse-themed physics-enabled objects to knock them down. The player has a limited number of shots and the level resets when the ammo is depleted. This project was programmed using the Blueprint system.
